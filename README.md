# L10n Schematic

Just checking out Angular Schematic. A cool feature but I guess it will take more time to learn than Angular itself.  

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.1.

## Testing with NPM Registry
I used verdaccio to test locally

## Functionality
This is an Angular schematic to setup [angular-l10n](https://github.com/robisim74/angular-l10n).   


* Has ng Add support
* Can create component with l10n support  
`ng g l10n-schema:l10n-component --name header`
